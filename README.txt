Easily curate streams of recent posts.  Pin, remove, or add posts to a stream via a drag and drop interface.

== Description ==

We created Stream Manager with news editors in mind.  Admins wanted the latest headlines to show up on the front page automatically, but didnâ€™t want to give up the flexibility of pinning a major story in a featured spot or pushing a smaller item down below the fold.  

Stream Manager provides a simple interface for curating feeds of new posts from the WordPress Admin.  New posts show up automatically at the top of a stream, but content can easily be added, removed, or repositioned on the page via the stream editor.  Admins also have the option of pinning a post, which will lock it in its current position regardless of new content.

Stream Manager is designed to work with Twig templating plugin [Timber](https://wordpress.org/plugins/timber-library/), as detailed in the installation instructions. Check out the [Timber project page](http://upstatement.com/timber/) for more info.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can streams be filtered by post type or category? =

Yes! Streams can be filtered by post type, taxonomy, or just about anything else that can be passed into a wp_query array.  Check out the [github readme](http://github.com/Upstatement/stream-manager) for details on filter hooks.
